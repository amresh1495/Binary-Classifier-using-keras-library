# Binary-Classifier-using-keras-library

In this notebook, I have implemented a basic binary classifier using Sequential() present in the keras library. I epoched it several times over and over again and tweaked the model several times to attain the best accuracy. At around epochs 380 - 410, I was getting the most accuracy which was around 77.5 % to 77.96 % after which it began to decrease. The best result was at 400 with an accuracy of 80.00 %.
